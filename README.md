# LambdaGators: Lambda Calculus Illustrator #
By Anarav Patel, Charles Rule, and Michael Rizzo 

For CS-314 Principles of Programming Languages Spring 2019 with Professor Ames. The goal was to make an application that can dynamically illustrate the computational steps of Lambda Calculus with the Alligator analogy provided in class. We loved this analogy as much as Professor Ames and it helped demystify lambda calculus by turning it into a fun subject. We wanted to take it one step further by making it into an interactive version that goes beyond basic expressions. We hope future students will want to use our final project and have the same enjoyable experience.  

We would like to acknowledge Bret Victor and [Worrydream.com](http://worrydream.com/AlligatorEggs/) for the initial concept. This is the same source that Professor Ames used in class. As well, we would like to thank
